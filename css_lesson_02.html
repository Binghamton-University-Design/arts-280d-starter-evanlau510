			<p>Toyota has finally revealed the U.S. version of the new 2022 GR 86 sports car, which now wears a GR designation, for Gazoo Racing. The details are nearly identical to its Subaru twin, the <a target="_blank"  title="2022 Subaru BRZ Page" href="https://www.subaru.com/2022-brz">2022 BRZ</a>, and the two rear-wheel-drive coupes feature a new, larger flat-four and various chassis improvements that should make them even more fun to drive than before.</p>
				
			<p>The GR 86's 2.4-liter flat-four officially makes 228 horsepower and 184 pound-feet. That's a useful improvement over the old car's 205 hp and 156 pound-feet. A six-speed manual transmission is standard, with a six-speed automatic optional. Toyota claims it will get to 60 mph in 6.1 seconds; for reference, our test of a 2020 model recorded a result of 6.2 seconds, so we think the new car might be even quicker than Toyota's claim.</p>

			<p>The base model comes standard with 17-inch wheels wrapped in Michelin Primacy HP tires, while the Premium trim level upgrades to 18-inch wheels with Michelin Pilot Sport 4 tires. Available exterior colors include Track bRed, Trueno Blue, Neptune Blue, Halo White, Steel Grey, Pavement Grey, and Raven Black.</p>

			<p>Like its predecessor, the GR 86 has two small rear seats that can fold to expand the trunk. Toyota says that the new car can fit a set of four tires with the seats folded like the old model. A 7.0-inch digital gauge cluster and an 8.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system are both standard equipment, as is Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.</p>

			<p>Toyota has yet to announce pricing, but we expect the GR 86 to start around $31,000.</p>
